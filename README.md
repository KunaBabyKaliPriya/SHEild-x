## Future Enhancements

### Infinite Map Loading
Currently, users need to manually download a city before exploring. We are working on infinite map scrolling - simply pan and zoom to any location, and the road network loads automatically in the background. This will eliminate manual download buttons for seamless exploration.

### Real Government Data Integration
Our current prototype uses sample incident data for demonstration. We plan to integrate with official government sources:
- iRAD (Integrated Road Accident Database) - Real accident statistics from Ministry of Road Transport
- Crime Bureau APIs - Historical crime data by location
- Traffic Police Feeds - Real-time incident reports

This will replace simulated data with authentic, verifiable safety intelligence.

### Community Rating System
After each journey, users will be able to:
- Rate the route safety on a 1-5 star scale
- Report specific concerns such as poor lighting, suspicious activity, or accidents
- Share photos or descriptions of unsafe conditions

This crowd-sourced data creates a living safety map that improves with every user interaction. Routes with consistently poor ratings will be automatically deprioritized.

### Voice Guidance and Alerts
Turn-by-turn voice instructions will announce:
- Upcoming turns with road names
- "Safe zone ahead" alerts when approaching police stations
- "Caution: poorly lit area" warnings
- "Hospital nearby" notifications
- Real-time rerouting if incidents are reported ahead

### Community-Driven Safety Network
Every user becomes a safety contributor. Ratings, reports, and feedback help other women travel safer. Together, we build a crowd-powered safety layer over traditional maps.

These enhancements will transform SHEild-X from a navigation application into a community-driven safety ecosystem for women.
